# 🧬 Golgi — A Healthcare Search Engine
**Making healthcare searchable.**  

[Golgi](https://goooolgi.streamlit.app/) is a Streamlit-based custom search engine for clinicians and researchers.  
It leverages LLM-powered search API to query medical & scientific evidence, then enhances the results with filtering, confidence scoring, and rich visual analytics.  

The Golgi apparatus in cells acts as a sorting, packaging, and distribution center for proteins. Similarly, Golgi the search engine acts as a distribution center for medical knowledge: sorting, organizing, and routing the right information to the right user at the right time.
